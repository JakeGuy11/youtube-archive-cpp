Welcome to youtube-archive, an application that archives youtube streams!

I am not responsible for anything you want to do with what you download.
That said, don't do anything against the creator's wishes or copyrights.

IMPORTANT:
This application utilizes web scraping, a technique to get data that's in something of a legal grey spot. It's unlikely but still a possibility that YouTube will attempt to block your computer from accessing their service. Measures have been and will continue to be taken in future releases to make it safer. It should be safe at the moment, but still, use it at your own risk.

To minimize the risk of YouTube blocking your computer, it is recommended that you change the interval time to as long as you can. The recommended safe time is 300 seconds.

To uninstall, run /opt/youtube-archive/uninstall.sh as root.

Queue options:
    -h, --help                                       Show this help message
    -a, --add <CHANNELURL> <NICKNAME>                Add a channel to the queue. Follow this by the channel's home page URL and an alphanumeric nickname of choice
    -r, --remove <IDENTIFIER>                        Remove a channel. Follow by the channel's nickname OR channel url
    -l, --list                                       List all channels and corresponding nicknames

Run options:
    -s, --start                                      Start the program after all other operations are completed
    -i, --interval <TIME>                            Set the interval time in seconds, the time between checking for new livestreams. Default is 45. Must be an integer
    -t, --temp <CHANNELURL> <NICKNAME>               Add a temporary channel to scan for. This will not be saved for future uses
    -f, --format <VIDEOFORMAT>                       Convert the downloaded video to the entered format. All formats supported by FFMPEG are supported by this program as well.
    -m, --move <LOCATION>                            Move the final video to the specified directory. The characters '~/' at the start of the path will indicate the home directory.
    -p, --print-level <LEVEL>                        Change the amount of printing the program does. -1 is quiet (errors only) and 1 is debug mode(not reccomended). Default is 0.
    -q, --quality-args <ARGS>                        Define custom quality arguments. Default is worst. See the end of this message for details and examples

A new feature has just been added: video quality selection. In past versions, this tool would download every stream in the best quality. Now, an option has been added that allows the user to specify the format and its properties. after passing the -q (or --quality-args) flag, follow it with any of the following arguments; "res" (resolution, valid values include 144, 480, 720, 1080, etc.), fps (frames per second) and tbr/abr/vbr (average/audio/video bitrate). Relative operators are required between the properties and the values, and different properties must be separated with commas. SURROUND THE ENTIRE STATEMENT WITH QUOTATION MARKS. For example, '"res=480,fps>=30"' will download the stream at 480p and 30fps or higher. If this format is not available, it will default to the worst quality that is 480p. See line 765 of the youtube-dl man page for all available properties. Note that some properties will not be relevant and may even cause errors.
