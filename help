Welcome to holo-dl, an application that archives HoloLive Streams!

Read before using:
Please do not re-upload the full stream. It's against HoloLive rules and overall not cool.
If you do, you're taking away views, likes, comments, subscribers and money from the HoloLive members.
I won't be responsible for what you do with the streams you save, but this is more than just a disclaimer.
In the future, a like and comment feature will be implemented so that you're not just taking the stream and giving nothing in return.
Until then, try your best to make all their streams and like, comment and subscribe on your own.

Queue/Meta information:
    -h, --help                                       Show this help message
    -a, --add [CHANNELURL] [NICKNAME]                Add a channel to the queue. Follow this by the channel's home page URL and an alphanumeric nickname of choice
    -r, --remove [IDENTIFIER]                        Remove a channel. Follow by the channel's nickname OR channel URL
    -l, --list                                       List all channels and corresponding nicknames

To run:
    -s, --start                                      Start the program after all other operations are completed
    -i, --interval [TIME]                            Set the interval time in seconds, the time between checking for new livestreams. Default is 30. Must be an integer
    -t, --temp [CHANNELURL] [NICKNAME]               Add a temporary channel to scan for. This will not be saved for future uses
