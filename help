TEMPORARY NOTE:
After some more testing, a new problem was revealed. Depending on the specs of your computer, downloading too many streams at once can corrupt small sections of the video and, in extreme cases, even cause the program to crash.
For now, it is recommended that you don't download more than one stream at a time if you're using a bad-medium laptop or a bad PC. If you have a good/gaming laptop or a medium/good/gaming PC, it's recommended that you don't download more than three streams at a time.
For reference, on a ThinkPad T530 (intel i7 @ 2.9GHz, 16GB DDR3), two streams could be downloaded at once with a very small amout of corruption.

If you want to maxumize preformance while downloading more than the reccomended amount of streams, you should not change the format (i.e. omit the -f option), as this takes up a lot of system resources. A fix will be provided soon.


Welcome to youtube-archive, an application that archives youtube streams!

I am not responsible for anything you want to do with what you download.
That said, don't do anything against the creator's wishes or copyrights.

IMPORTANT:
This application utilizes web scraping, a technique to get data that's in something of a legal grey spot. It's unlikely but still a possibility that YouTube will attempt to block your computer from accessing their service. Measures have been and will continue to be taken in future releases to make it safer. It should be safe at the moment, but still, use it at your own risk.

To minimize the risk of YouTube blocking your computer, it is recommended that you change the interval time to as long as you can. The recommended safe time is 300 seconds.

To uninstall, run /opt/youtube-archive/uninstall.sh as root.
