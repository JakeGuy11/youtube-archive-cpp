Welcome to holo-dl, an application that archives HoloLive Streams!

Read before using:
Please do not re-upload the full stream. It's against HoloLive rules and overall not cool.
If you do, you're taking away views, likes, comments, subscribers and money from the HoloLive members.
I won't be responsible for what you do with the streams you save, but this is more than just a disclaimer.
In the future, a like and comment feature will be implemented so that you're not just taking the stream and giving nothing in return.
Until then, try your best to make all their streams and like, comment and subscribe on your own.

Set preferences:
    Use "add" followed by the channel's home page URL followed by a nickname of the channel to add this channel to the queue
    Use "remove" followed by the channel's nickname OR channel URL to remove it from the queue

To run:
    Use "go" to run the program
    To set the interval time, add the number of seconds you want to wait until the service checks for new streams after "go"
    The recommended (and default) value is 120.

Examples:

./run go 180
Run the service, check for new streams every 3 minutes

./run add {channel url} Okayu
Add {channel url}'s channel to the queue under the nickname "Okayu"

./run remove Okayu
Remove the entry with the nickname "Okayu" from the queue
